   - Extract key columns (location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population) for a more focused analysis.

3. **Infection Rate Calculation:**
   - Calculate the percentage of the population infected by Covid-19 for each location and date.

4. **Highest Infection Rate Identification:**
   - Determine the countries with the highest infection rates relative to their populations.

5. **Death Count Analysis:**
   - Identify countries and continents with the highest total death counts due to Covid-19.

6. **Global Numbers Calculation:**
   - Summarize the total number of cases and deaths globally.

7. **Vaccination Data Exploration:**
   - Analyze vaccination data to understand the percentage of people vaccinated over time.

8. **Death to Vaccination Ratio:**
   - Calculate the ratio of deaths to vaccinations to assess the impact of vaccination efforts on mortality rates.
